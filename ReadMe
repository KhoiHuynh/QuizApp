Description: Application is a trivia quiz about dogs.

Learning Experience:
    This is my very first android app (aside from "Hello World") and i found this to be very helpful
first app as it goes through many different parts of a well built app (app layout, logic, objects,
activity life cycle, etc...).

    In terms of learning of the business aspect, i feel like this app did not teach much much about
business in the app world. However the classes that we do in class leading up to the creation of
this app was a great introduction to how apps have a large impact in the business world. I already
knew how apps have a large influence and market for everyone, but going into deeper detail in class
has really widened my knowledge. It also has inspired me to come up with new app ideas and create
apps that benefit both companies and consumers.
